networkGen Package
==================

This package is used to generate network mazes. Currently it is at the version 0.1.0.

The functions will help you to generate trail or circuit type mazes.

In some of the mazes, unidirectional arrows can be included (Up to 3 arrows).

More to come soon!

R/networkGen is an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package with R functions that are useful to me for automatically generating network mazes for research. These are the most important functions in the package.
